The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE).
In addition to reading and writing pages from a file,
it provides methods for creating, opening, and closing files.

At first, create a new page file with a input fileName.
    for malloc(), need free().
    for fwrite(), need fclose() in Create, or it will re-open in the next time.

Then, open the page file with fileName and fileHandle.
    use fileStat to determine the file size.
    fseek+ftell can do the same thing, but it has some vulnerabilities for the binary stream.

For close and destory Page.
    need to update the info of fileHandle.
    Note: before destory a file, it's better to close the file.
          Or it may cause the failure of remove in Windows.

 For read:
    take notice of the page position.

 For write:
    when pageNum is more than total num , it will append empty block and do it one by one.
